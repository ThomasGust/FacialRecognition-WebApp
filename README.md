# SAASGo-WebApp
This repository contains the code of a Webapp I made for my 7th grade innovations project. We had a problem at school were people would be cutting in line a ton. As somewhat of a joke solution, I made this face detection software with the idea we could text kids parents if they cut in line. Please don't implement this as a real thing at your school as it feels highly unethical. The system works by saving a representation of each new person's face to a datastore (which in my joke project would have been gathered from yearbook photos), and then comparing the similarity of new faces to each in that dataset. A lot of the code for implementing that datastore itself comes from user:susantabiswas. Props to him, his repository can be found at https://github.com/susantabiswas/FaceRecog.
