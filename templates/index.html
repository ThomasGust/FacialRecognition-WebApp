<h2 class="shadow" >The Problem</h2>
<div class="a">
    <div>
    <h5>The lunch line at SAAS is quite slow. Most of the time in the lunch line comes from people needing to scan their cards at the front, or forgetting their cards entirely and needing to put in their number.</h5>

    </div>
    <div>
    <h5>SAASGo aims to fix this problem by utilizing cutting edge AI technology, and the emulation of Amazon Go stores (I'm really bad at naming things).</h5>
    </div>
    <h5>Students only need to give one image of their face to the SAASGo system, and they will never need to scan those pesky cards again!</h5>
    <div>
    <h5>&nbsp;</h5>
    <h5>Do I have any volunteers for a demonstration?</h5>

<h3 class="shadow"> Prototype 1</h3>
<div>
<h5>My first prototype was really just a concept, I wrote out what I wanted the system to look like, including all critical features, such as check in and check out.</h5>
</div>
<h3 class="shadow"> Prototype 2</h3>
<div>
<h5>Prototype 2 included a more fleshed out design, including a mask detector to get a basic face recognition system up and running.</h5>

<h3 class="shadow"> Prototype 3</h3>
<div>
<h5>Prototype 3 was a localized face detector program that could recognize faces in a hardcoded dataset.</h5>
</div>

<h3 class="shadow">Final Model</h3>
<div>
<h5>My Final Model is this website! People can upload a dataset of faces and then use a model (generated at runtime), for face detection on that dataset.</h5>
