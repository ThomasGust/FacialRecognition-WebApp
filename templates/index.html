<h2 class="shadow" >The Problem</h2>
<div class="a">
    <div>
    <h5>The lunch line at SAAS is quite slow. Most of the time in the lunch line comes from people needing to scan their cards at the front, or forgetting their cards entirely and needing to put in their number.</h5>

    </div>
    <div>
    <h5>SAASGo aims to fix this problem by utilizing cutting edge AI technology, and the emulation of Amazon Go stores (I'm really bad at naming things).</h5>
    </div>
    <h5>Students only need to give one image of their face to the SAASGo system, and they will never need to scan those pesky cards again!</h5>
    <div>
    <h5>&nbsp;</h5>
    <h5>Do I have any volunteers for a demonstration?</h5>

<h3 class="shadow"> Prototype 1</h3>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
<div>
<h5>My first prototype was really just a concept, I wrote out what I wanted the system to look like, including all critical features, such as check in and check out.</h5>
</div>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
<h3 class="shadow"> Prototype 2</h3>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
<div>
<h5>Prototype 2 included a more fleshed out design, including a mask detector to get a basic face recognition system up and running.</h5>
</div>

<div><img src='static/maskdetector.png' style="width:300;height:300px;"></div>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
<h3 class="shadow"> Prototype 3</h3>
<h5>&nbsp;</h5>
<div>
<h5>Prototype 3 was a localized face detector program that could recognize faces in a hardcoded dataset.</h5>
</div>
<div>
<img src='static/ThomasBeingDetected.png' style="width:500;height:300px;">
</div>
<h3 class="shadow">Final Model</h3>
<div>
<h5>My Final Model is this website! People can upload a dataset of faces and then use a model (generated at runtime), for face detection on that dataset.</h5>
</div>

Project Reflection
</h3>
<h5>The most challenging part of this project was deploying this webapp to heroku, in which I ran in to dozens of unexpected errors that each took hours to troubleshoot.</h5>
<h5>This app is basically my prototype 4 already, but if I were to do a 5th iteration I would probably try to make this system scale better, right now it can only have a few people on it before it begins to break down.</h5>
<h5>I am most proud of the model uploading functionality. It took me a while to figure out how to properly handle the images, and then to generate the table on the model dashboard, but I learned alot and am proud of the final result.</h5>

Class Refelction
</h3>
<h5>I learned that persistence is rewarded. Many of the errors I had took my literal hours to debug, but I was always rewarded in the end. This project reinforced the importance of persistence to me</h5>
<h5>I feel that the iterative design process can be applied to all sorts of things in life, not just programming and innovations. Whenever I have any sort of problem in my life, I can always approach it with an iterative design thinking process.</h5>
<h5>I am very proud of my final project from innovations class. I put a lot of time into this webapp and am proud of the final result I was able to create, even if there is still plenty of room for improvement.</h5>
